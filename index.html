                <p><strong>Happy Birthday.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin, because there are so
                  many things I want to say to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First of all, I just want you to know how incredibly special
                  you are. Not just today, not just on your birthday, but every
                  single day. You have this way of making everything around you
                  feel lighter, warmer, and happier without even trying. You
                  probably don&rsquo;t realize it, but your presence alone makes
                  a difference in people&rsquo;s lives &mdash; especially mine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&rsquo;m really grateful to have you in my life. Grateful for
                  your kindness, your smile, your energy, your little quirks,
                  and the way you care. You&rsquo;re the kind of person who
                  leaves a positive mark wherever you go, and that&rsquo;s
                  something rare and beautiful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes I think about how lucky I am to know you. To talk to
                  you. To laugh with you. To share random moments, deep
                  conversations, and everything in between. Even the smallest
                  interactions with you mean more to me than I can properly
                  explain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You deserve so much happiness, Chotu. You deserve to wake up
                  every day feeling loved, appreciated, and excited about life.
                  You deserve dreams that come true, goals that turn into
                  reality, and a future filled with beautiful experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I hope this year brings you growth, confidence, peace, and
                  countless reasons to smile. I hope you discover new things
                  about yourself, chase what truly makes you happy, and never
                  doubt how amazing you are.&nbsp;Even on days when you feel
                  tired, unsure, or overwhelmed, I hope you know there is
                  someone out there who believes in you, supports you, and cares
                  about you more than words can say.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I made this little website for you because I wanted to give
                  you something different. Something personal. Something that
                  shows a small part of how much you mean to me. It&rsquo;s not
                  perfect, but it comes straight from the heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With lots of love,<br />
                  &mdash; Someone who truly cares 🐣
