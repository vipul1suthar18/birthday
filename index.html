            <h2 class="handwritten">Dear Chotu 💖</h2>
            <p><strong>Happy Birthday.</strong></p>
            <p>
              I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin, because there are so many
              things I want to say to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, I just want you to know how incredibly special you
              are. Not just today, not just on your birthday, but every single
              day. You have this way of making everything around you feel
              lighter, warmer, and happier without even trying. You probably
              don&rsquo;t realize it, but your presence alone makes a difference
              in people&rsquo;s lives &mdash; especially mine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&rsquo;m really grateful to have you in my life. Grateful for
              your kindness, your smile, your energy, your little quirks, and
              the way you care. You&rsquo;re the kind of person who leaves a
              positive mark wherever you go, and that&rsquo;s something rare and
              beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes I think about how lucky I am to know you. To talk to
              you. To laugh with you. To share random moments, deep
              conversations, and everything in between. Even the smallest
              interactions with you mean more to me than I can properly explain.
            </p>
            <p>
              You deserve so much happiness, Chotu. You deserve to wake up every
              day feeling loved, appreciated, and excited about life. You
              deserve dreams that come true, goals that turn into reality, and a
              future filled with beautiful experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope this year brings you growth, confidence, peace, and
              countless reasons to smile. I hope you discover new things about
              yourself, chase what truly makes you happy, and never doubt how
              amazing you are.&nbsp;Even on days when you feel tired, unsure, or
              overwhelmed, I hope you know there is someone out there who
              believes in you, supports you, and cares about you more than words
              can say.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made this little website for you because I wanted to give you
              something different. Something personal. Something that shows a
              small part of how much you mean to me. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but
              it comes straight from the heart.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
            Thank you for being you.<br />
            Thank you for existing.<br />
            Thank you for making the world a little brighter.
          </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
            Happy Birthday, Chotu 🎂💖<br />
            May this year be kind to you, and may all your wishes slowly find
            their way to you.
          </p> -->
            <p>
              With lots of love,<br />
              &mdash; Someone who truly cares 🐣
